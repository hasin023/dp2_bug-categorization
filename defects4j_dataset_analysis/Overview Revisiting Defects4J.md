# Revisiting Defects4J for Bug Categorization

The public repository [Studying-Data-Cleanness-in-Defects4J](https://github.com/nakhlarafi/Studying-Data-Cleanness-in-Defects4J) provides rich datasets from analyzing Defects4J (version 2.0.0) focusing on fault-triggering tests and their evolution patterns. The research covers **809 bugs from 16 Java open-source systems** with **1,655 fault-triggering tests**. The key finding is that **77% of fault-triggering tests were modified/added after bug reports**, revealing different development scenarios that can be leveraged for comprehensive bug categorization.

## Research Questions Clarification

### **RQ1: Were Fault-triggering Tests Added/Modified After a Bug Was Reported?**

**Purpose**: This research question investigates the **timeline** of when fault-triggering tests were created or modified relative to when bugs were originally reported.

**Key Motivation**: When fault localization techniques analyze code coverage, they rely heavily on fault-triggering tests. However, if these tests were created or modified after developers already knew about the bug (and potentially its fix), the tests might contain "insider knowledge" that wouldn't be available in real-world scenarios when the bug was first discovered.

**Main Research Findings**:

- **77% of fault-triggering tests** in Defects4J were either added or modified during the bug-fixing process (after the bug report was created)
- **Four distinct patterns** were identified:
  - **Pattern 1 (53%)**: Tests created after bug report - 872 tests covering 558 bugs
  - **Pattern 2 (2%)**: Tests created and then modified after bug report - 44 tests covering 31 bugs
  - **Pattern 3 (22%)**: Tests modified after bug report - 362 tests covering 155 bugs
  - **Pattern 4 (23%)**: Tests unchanged during bugs

**Significance**: Only 23% of tests were able to detect bugs as originally intended, meaning most tests contain post-resolution information that could bias fault localization research.

### **RQ2: How Do Developers Modify the Fault-triggering Tests?**

**Purpose**: This question examines **what types of changes** developers make to fault-triggering tests and **why** they make these modifications.

**Research Approach**: Manual analysis of 300 fault-triggering tests using stratified sampling with 95% confidence level, employing open coding methodology with Cohen's Kappa score of 0.86 indicating substantial agreement.

**Five Categories of Modifications Discovered**:

1. **Adding New Test (63% - 189/300)**: Tests specifically created to reproduce bugs for regression testing purposes
2. **Adjusting Test Outputs (20% - 58/300)**: Tests modified to accommodate bug-fixing changes in source code
3. **Adding New Assertion (13% - 41/300)**: New assertions added to help reproduce bugs during the bug-fixing process
4. **Improving Test Logic During Bug Fixes (2% - 7/300)**: Logic modifications while replicating bugs, including simplifying complex logic and reorganizing code structure
5. **Others (1% - 2/300)**: Code formatting, cleanup of obsolete variables/comments

### Pattern-Based Bug Categorization (Key Research Finding)

The research identified **4 distinct patterns** based on test evolution that serve as a primary categorization framework:

**Pattern 1 (53% of tests)**: Tests created after bug report

- Represents bugs requiring **new regression tests**
- Contains **post-resolution information** from developers
- Indicates **high complexity bugs** needing specialized test creation
- Example: CLI-144 where developers created BugCLI144Test specifically for the bug

**Pattern 2 (2% of tests)**: Tests created then modified after bug report

- Shows **iterative test development** process
- Indicates **collaborative debugging** with multiple enhancement cycles
- Represents bugs with **evolving understanding** during resolution

**Pattern 3 (22% of tests)**: Existing tests modified after bug report

- Shows **enhancement of existing test coverage**
- Includes **bug-specific assertion additions**
- Represents bugs caught by existing tests but requiring **test oracle updates**

**Pattern 4 (23% of tests)**: Tests unchanged during resolution

- Represents **clean bug detection** scenarios
- Shows bugs with **minimal developer intervention** needed
- Indicates **well-designed original tests** that properly caught the bug

### Test Modification Categories (RQ2 Findings)

From manual analysis of 300 tests, researchers identified **5 modification categories**[^1]:

| Category                   | Count | Percentage | Bug Categorization Relevance          |
| :------------------------- | :---- | :--------- | :------------------------------------ |
| **Adding New Test**        | 189   | 63%        | Bug reproduction complexity indicator |
| **Adjusting Test Outputs** | 58    | 20%        | Code evolution impact measurement     |
| **Adding New Assertion**   | 41    | 13%        | Bug scope expansion analysis          |
| **Improving Test Logic**   | 7     | 2%         | Test quality improvement tracking     |
| **Others (formatting)**    | 2     | 1%         | Maintenance activity classification   |

## Bug Categorization Applications

### 1. **Severity-Based Categorization**

**Data Sources for Implementation:**

- Pattern distribution (more complex bugs â†’ Pattern 1/2)
- Timeline data (`report_creation` to `report_resolution`)
- Test modification complexity (from `manual_study/`)

**Categorization Logic:**

```python
def categorize_severity(pattern, modification_count, resolution_time_days):
    if pattern in [1, 2]:  # Tests created after report
        if modification_count > 3 or resolution_time_days > 30:
            return "Critical"  # Required extensive new test creation
        else:
            return "High"  # Required new test creation
    elif pattern == 3:  # Tests modified
        if modification_count > 2:
            return "Medium"  # Multiple enhancements needed
        else:
            return "Low"  # Minor enhancement needed
    else:  # pattern == 4
        return "Low"  # Existing tests sufficient
```

### 2. **Root Cause Categorization**

**Data Sources:**

- Test modification categories (from `manual.xlsx`)
- Code changes (from `code_changes/` directory)
- Original bug reports (via `report_url`)

**Root Cause Categories:**

- **Logic Errors**: Pattern 4 bugs (tests already failing properly)
- **Interface/API Changes**: "Adjusting Test Outputs" category (20% of modifications)
- **Edge Cases**: "Adding New Assertion" category (13% of modifications)
- **Complex System Issues**: Pattern 1 with multiple modifications

### 3. **Type-Based Categorization**

**Leveraging Multi-System Data:**
The dataset covers **16 different Java systems** across various domains:

- **CLI Tools**: Cli (39 bugs)
- **Compilers**: Closure (174 bugs)
- **Data Processing**: Codec (18 bugs), Csv (16 bugs)
- **JSON Processing**: Gson (18 bugs), Jackson\* (144+ bugs total)
- **Web Parsing**: Jsoup (93 bugs)
- **Utility Libraries**: Lang (64 bugs), Math (106 bugs)

**Bug Type Classification:**

- **Parser Bugs**: Common in Cli, Csv systems (often Pattern 3)
- **Concurrency Issues**: Frequently require Pattern 1 (new comprehensive tests)
- **API Misuse**: Often Pattern 3 (assertion additions)
- **Performance Issues**: May span multiple patterns depending on detection method

### 4. **Development Context Categorization**

**Key Dimensions:**

- **Pre-existing vs Post-hoc Detection**: Pattern 4 vs Patterns 1-3
- **Collaborative vs Individual Effort**: Multiple modifications (Pattern 2)
- **Regression-focused Development**: Pattern 1 with test creation for future prevention
- **Enhancement-driven**: Pattern 3 with incremental test improvements

## Implementation Roadmap for Bug Categorization

### Step 1: Data Loading and Preparation

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from datetime import datetime

# Load primary dataset (1,656 records)
main_data = pd.read_csv('fault_triggering_tests.csv')

# Load timeline information for temporal analysis
timeline_bugs = pd.read_csv('timeline/bug_report.csv')
timeline_fixes = pd.read_csv('timeline/bug_fix.csv')

# Load manual study results (300 manually analyzed tests)
manual_study = pd.read_excel('manual_study/manual.xlsx')

# Load system metadata
bug_repos = pd.read_csv('bug_repository.csv')
```

### Step 2: Pattern-Based Analysis

```python
# Analyze pattern distribution across systems
pattern_analysis = main_data.groupby(['project', 'pattern']).agg({
    'bugid': 'count',
    'report_creation': 'min',
    'report_resolution': 'max'
}).reset_index()

# Calculate resolution times for severity analysis
main_data['resolution_time_days'] = (
    pd.to_datetime(main_data['report_resolution']) -
    pd.to_datetime(main_data['report_creation'])
).dt.days

# Count modifications per bug for complexity assessment
main_data['modification_count'] = main_data['datetime_modified'].apply(
    lambda x: len(eval(x)) if pd.notna(x) and x != '[]' else 0
)
```

### Step 3: Multi-Dimensional Bug Categorization

```python
def comprehensive_bug_categorization(row):
    """
    Comprehensive bug categorization using multiple dimensions
    """
    categories = {
        # Primary pattern-based category
        'pattern': row['pattern'],

        # Complexity assessment
        'complexity': 'high' if row['pattern'] in [1,2] else
                     'medium' if row['pattern'] == 3 else 'low',

        # Development phase
        'development_phase': 'post-report' if row['pattern'] != 4 else 'pre-existing',

        # Test evolution type
        'test_evolution': 'created' if row['created'] else
                         'modified' if row['pattern'] == 3 else 'unchanged',

        # System domain (based on project)
        'system_domain': get_system_domain(row['project']),

        # Temporal characteristics
        'resolution_speed': 'fast' if row['resolution_time_days'] < 7 else
                           'medium' if row['resolution_time_days'] < 30 else 'slow'
    }
    return categories

# Apply categorization
main_data['comprehensive_categories'] = main_data.apply(
    comprehensive_bug_categorization, axis=1
)

def get_system_domain(project):
    domain_map = {
        'Cli': 'command_line', 'Closure': 'compiler', 'Codec': 'encoding',
        'Csv': 'data_processing', 'Gson': 'json_processing',
        'JacksonCore': 'json_processing', 'JacksonDatabind': 'json_processing',
        'Jsoup': 'web_parsing', 'Lang': 'utilities', 'Math': 'mathematics',
        'Mockito': 'testing', 'Time': 'datetime'
    }
    return domain_map.get(project, 'other')
```

### Step 4: Bug Report Content Analysis

```python
# Access original bug reports for content-based categorization
def extract_bug_content(report_url, project):
    """
    Extract bug report content based on issue tracker type
    """
    if 'jira' in report_url.lower():
        return extract_jira_content(report_url)
    elif 'github' in report_url.lower():
        return extract_github_content(report_url)
    else:
        return extract_generic_content(report_url)

# Apply content extraction for NLP-based categorization
main_data['bug_report_content'] = main_data.apply(
    lambda row: extract_bug_content(row['report_url'], row['project'])
    if pd.notna(row['report_url']) else None,
    axis=1
)
```
